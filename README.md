I'm a beardy programmer with dyslexy and with its positives and negatives. I did achieved much since i learnt how to live and !work! with my gift.<br/> Since i'm development/progress driven-minded i'm looking for a challenging, diversive, friendly environment to work in, i'm also not afraid of doing repetetive things if those are not for life-time.
