I'm a beardy programmer with dyslexy and with its positives and negatives who is eager to create. I did achieved much since i learnt how to live and !work! with my gift.<br/> Since i'm development/progress driven-minded i'm looking for a challenging, diversive, friendly environment to work in, i'm also not afraid of doing repetetive things if those are not for life-time.

Experience
---

I got 14 years of experience in logistics/warehousing on multiple levels, various environments, lots of employers, pluss a few years in a bakery while i adapting to this new country.

Nokia Display Products Hungary (1996-1997),<br/>warehouse operative<br/>Nothing special just putting things from A to B, count them, etc...

Elcoteq Hungary (1998-2002),<br/>warehouse operative/team leader<br/>I was a member of a six-sigma team to filter out the bottle-necks in production, gave me a really good error-pinpointing skill in an already working environment. When we were QS9000 certified we got a contract from NASA - not a big deal making circuit-boards for weather ballons but NASA. Its on my CV.

Atlas-Copco Hungary (2005-2006),<br/>junior logistics/buyer/warehouse person/finance assistant<br/>First proper all-round job with international organising/shipping/buying duties.

Solectron Hungary (2006-2008),<br/>team leader of panasonic, sony-ericsson, NEC, HP-handheld project warehouses.<br/>Being a shift-leader where's no other just you. Working with a team that fully trained on what they doing, helping out other teams, taking off loads from superiors is priceless. Promotion, promotion, promotion. More to say?

Allied Bakeries Stoke (2010-2015)<br/>bakery operative.<br/>Other, short-term job in between them.
